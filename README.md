Practicing deployment and automation by generating weekly reports on 
the NFL curtesy from [nflfastr](https://www.nflfastr.com/)

**See the report [here](NFL-Report.md)**


Analysis Ideas
---
ðŸ”² add down analysis. Are there any trends on the play type on a down? Who is going it the most on 4th?     
ðŸ”² Track changes in down distribution of run vs pass for each team over time. Example: Look how Cowboys changed how much they ran the ball between weeks 2 and 3.   
ðŸ”² Weighting EPA: Weight EPA performance based on the opponent. Either win percentage or rank in terms of offense & defense. Say the Cowboys put up a lot of EPA against a team with a strong defense rank/performance. That should weight more than putting up points against a week defense.
